<p>Hey, I don't know , if it is just me or what?.I never get satisfied with anything I have built. So technically every project is in my "junk drawer" ðŸ«£. After working on My project: <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mikroller/ai-autonomous-room-rover-robot-a2r3-part-2-48f5a5">A2R3</a> Robotic platform ,then the motivational "junk drawer" challenge appeared on <a href="https://www.hackster.io/contests/junkdrawer24">hackster.io</a>. Chi...ching...it is time to clean up some junk with motivation. Yolu is based on the A2R3 platform but with some personalities.</p>
<p>It wonders around the house, makes some noises , show some moods and attitudes.</p>
<p>My A2R3 project has evolved so much and I am building it in parts (<a href="https://www.hackster.io/mikroller/ai-autonomous-room-rover-robot-a2r3-part-1-ddfe6b"> A2R3-1</a>,<a href="https://www.hackster.io/mikroller/ai-autonomous-room-rover-robot-a2r3-part-2-48f5a5"> A2R3-2</a>, A2R3-3 coming soon...). 
 Each part has been a learning experience as well as a fun one.</p>
